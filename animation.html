	<p> On May 13th, 2999 at 1400 hours, a lieutenant and his squadmates were patroling downtown when they seemed to have spotted Hector del Toro enter an abandoned warehouse. Rather than call for backup, the lieutenant thought they could get the jump on Hector as they haven't been discovered yet. They enter the warehouse carefully, planning to surround and attack him from multiple angles. However, the lights cut off and the lieutenant and his squadmates were attacked in the dark. The footage above shows Hector charging at the lieutenant and attacking him with a military grade sword, ending his life.</p>
	<p> The fallen lieutenant and his squad were later tracked down and after they failed to respond to communication protocols. Their bodies and body cam footage was recovered, yet Hector was no where to be seen.
